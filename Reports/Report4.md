## Theory: 
<p align="justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The Chomsky normal form imposes two restrictions on the production rules of a CFG:
Each production rule must be of the form A → BC or A → a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol.
The starting symbol S cannot appear on the right-hand side of any production rule.
By applying these restrictions, we can simplify the analysis and processing of the grammar. For example, it becomes easier to check if a string belongs to the language generated by the grammar, or to construct a parse tree for the string.
The conversion of a CFG to Chomsky normal form involves several steps, such as eliminating epsilon productions, eliminating unit productions, and introducing new non-terminal symbols. This process can sometimes result in an exponential blow-up of the size of the grammar, but it is still a useful technique in many cases.
Chomsky normal form is also related to other concepts in formal language theory, such as pushdown automata, the pumping lemma, and the CYK parsing algorithm. It has applications in various fields, such as natural language processing, computational biology, and compiler design. <p>
## Objectives:
1. Learn about Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) [1].
2. Get familiar with the approaches of normalizing a grammar.
3. Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF.
    1. The implementation needs to be encapsulated in a method with an appropriate signature (also ideally in an appropriate class/type).
    2. The implemented functionality needs executed and tested.
    3. A BONUS point will be given for the student who will have unit tests that validate the functionality of the project.
    4. Also, another BONUS point would be given if the student will make the aforementioned function to accept any grammar, not only the one from the student's variant.
